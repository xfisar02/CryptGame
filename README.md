# CryptGame
Demonstration od cryptographic problems through an interactive educational game

## Details
**Created by:

Repository contains a cryptography game that was developed as part of a bachelor's degree project

The purpose of the project is to familiarize users with the basic issues of cryptography. The form of the computer game is illustrative and entertaining, so it is the best choice in this case. For this purpose, the Java programming language and the JavaFX framework are used, through which we develop the user interface. It is possible to choose the difficulty level, which will determine the complexity of the ciphers. At the same time, a score is stored for each player for successfully successfully cracked ciphers.

Uses Java and JavaFx.

## Features
- 3 difficulties (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD)
- PC Console Themed
- Ciphers Available: Password Cracking, Morse Cipher, Caesar Cipher, Atbash Cipher, Polybius Cipher, Vigenere Cipher, Bifid Cipher
- Saves score and player name
- Unique hints for each cipher
- Switching between ciphers and menu
- Learning about ciphers in a fun way

## Implementation
- Navigation is via FXML files
